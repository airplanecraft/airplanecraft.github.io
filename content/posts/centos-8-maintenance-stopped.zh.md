## Centos 8 維護已經停止了

    年前安裝了centos8.2 yum 的repo還是用的默認的，一切都正常,昨天在新的服務器上發現yum的repo已經無法使用了，我當時就意識到應該維護停止了，馬上去網上查一下，果然如此，如果想繼續使用請替換掉原來的mirror，使用centos-vault，https://mirrors.aliyun.com/centos-vault/ 或者 https://vault.centos.org/8.2.2004/

## Centos 7 的維護還是會繼續到2024年

    CentOS yes Community Enterprise Operating System（ Community enterprise operating system ） An acronym for , yes 100％ Reconstructed RHEL（ Red Hat Enterprise Linux）. Even though RHEL It costs money , but CentOS It's free. , Community supported businesses Linux Distribution version . Good at Linux And don't want to pay RHEL Support fee developers and companies always choose CentOS To save money and get enterprise software .

    however , Now the free ride is over ！ Red cap announced , As RHEL 8 A reconstructed version of ,CentOS Linux 8 Will be in 2021 In the end .

    CentOS 7 No impact！CentoS 7 Will continue in RHEL 7 In the life cycle (2024 end of the year ) Continue to get support . So right. CentOS 7 The user has no effect at the moment .

    
    
    We're going to focus on rebuilding RHEL Of CentOS Linux Transferred to the CentOS Stream.CentOS Stream Will serve as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Upstream （ Development ） Branch . in other words , in the future ,Fedora It's still the first upstream , But in RHEL After the release of the new version ,CentOS Stream It's going to be rolling on top of it , And feed the mature update back to RHEL among .

## 是時候考慮繼續使用centos還是切換到其他的linux發行版本
