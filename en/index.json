Read more about usePageBundles.\nWith page bundles, resources for a page or section, like images or attached files, live in the same directory as the content itself rather than in your static directory.\nHugo Clarity supports the use of leaf bundles, which are any directories within the content directory that contain an index.md file. Hugo's documentation gives this example:\n1content 2├── about 3│ ├── index.md 4├── posts 5│ ├── my-post 6│ │ ├── content1.md 7│ │ ├── content2.md 8│ │ ├── image1.jpg 9│ │ ├── image2.png 10│ │ └── index.md 11│ └── my-other-post 12│ └── index.md 13│ 14└── another-section 15 ├── .. 16 └── not-a-leaf-bundle 17 ├── .. 18 └── another-leaf-bundle 19 └── index.md In the above example `content` directory, there are four leaf bundles: about: This leaf bundle is at the root level (directly under content directory) and has only the index.md.\nmy-post: This leaf bundle has the index.md, two other content Markdown files and two image files. image1 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources. image2 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources.\nmy-other-post: This leaf bundle has only the index.md.\nanother-leaf-bundle: This leaf bundle is nested under couple of directories. This bundle also has only the index.md.\nThe hierarchy depth at which a leaf bundle is created does not matter, as long as it is not inside another leaf bundle.\nAdvantages to using page bundles The image below is part of the bundle of this page, and is located at content/post/bundle/building.png. Because it's within this page's bundle, the markup for the image only has to specify the image's filename, building.png.\nIf you ever change the name of the directory in which this Markdown file and the image reside, the reference to the image would not need to be updated.\nIn addition to more cleanly organizing your content and related assets, when using page bundles, Hugo Clarity will automatically generate markup for modern image formats, which are smaller in file size.\nFor instance, when you reference an image like building.png, Hugo Clarity will check to see if the same image (based on filename) exists in WebP, AVIF or JXL formats. If you inspect the image above, you'll see a \u0026lt;source\u0026gt; element for building.webp, because that file is also present. Hugo Clarity will only include the markup if these images exist.\nBrowsers that support these formats and the \u0026lt;picture\u0026gt; element will load them, while browsers that do not will fall-back to the default image. Read more about this process.\nFinally, note that page assets can be further managed and refined within the page's front matter if you wish, and are not limited to images alone.\nDisadvantages to using page bundles Page resources in a bundle are only available to the page with which they are bundled — that means you can't include an image with one page and then reference it from another.\nImages that are being used in multiple places are more appropriate for your Hugo assets directory. Unlike files in the Hugo static directory, files in the assets directory can be run through Hugo Pipes, which includes image processing.\n","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/post/bundle/","section":"post","tags":["Hugo"],"title":"Using Hugo page bundles english"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/tags/oauth2.0/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Oauth2.0"},{"body":"what is oauth2.0 OAuth 2.0, which stands for “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user. It replaced OAuth 1.0 in 2012 and is now the d industry standard for online authorization. OAuth 2.0 provides consented access and restricts actions of what the client app can perform on resources on behalf of the user, without ever sharing the user's credentials.\narchitecture OAuth2.0 Roles https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2014/05/oauth_2_0.html\nResource Owner: The user or system that owns the protected resources and can grant access to them.\nClient: The client is the system that requires access to the protected resources. To access resources, the Client must hold the appropriate Access Token.\nAuthorization Server: This server receives requests from the Client for Access Tokens and issues them upon successful authentication and consent by the Resource Owner. The authorization server exposes two endpoints: the Authorization endpoint, which handles the interactive authentication and consent of the user, and the Token endpoint, which is involved in a machine to machine interaction.\nResource Server: A server that protects the user’s resources and receives access requests from the Client. It accepts and validates an Access Token from the Client and returns the appropriate resources to it.\nOAuth 2.0 Access Tokens and Authorization Code The OAuth 2 Authorization server may not directly return an Access Token after the Resource Owner has authorized access. Instead, and for better security, an Authorization Code may be returned, which is then exchanged for an Access Token. In addition, the Authorization server may also issue a Refresh Token with the Access Token. Unlike Access Tokens, Refresh Tokens normally have long expiry times and may be exchanged for new Access Tokens when the latter expires. Because Refresh Tokens have these properties, they have to be stored securely by clients.\nGrant Types in OAuth 2.0 In OAuth 2.0, grants are the set of steps a Client has to perform to get resource access authorization. The authorization framework provides several grant types to address different scenarios:\nAuthorization Code grant: The Authorization server returns a single-use Authorization Code to the Client, which is then exchanged for an Access Token. This is the best option for traditional web apps where the exchange can securely happen on the server side. The Authorization Code flow might be used by Single Page Apps (SPA) and mobile/native apps. However, here, the client secret cannot be stored securely, and so authentication, during the exchange, is limited to the use of client id alone. A better alternative is the Authorization Code with PKCE grant, below.\nImplicit Grant: A simplified flow where the Access Token is returned directly to the Client. In the Implicit flow, the authorization server may return the Access Token as a parameter in the callback URI or as a response to a form post. The first option is now deprecated due to potential token leakage.\nAuthorization Code Grant with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE): This authorization flow is similar to the Authorization Code grant, but with additional steps that make it more secure for mobile/native apps and SPAs.\nResource Owner Credentials Grant Type: This grant requires the Client first to acquire the resource owner’s credentials, which are passed to the Authorization server. It is, therefore, limited to Clients that are completely trusted. It has the advantage that no redirect to the Authorization server is involved, so it is applicable in the use cases where a redirect is infeasible.\nClient Credentials Grant Type: Used for non-interactive applications e.g., automated processes, microservices, etc. In this case, the application is authenticated per se by using its client id and secret.\nDevice Authorization Flow: A grant that enables use by apps on input-constrained devices, such as smart TVs.\nRefresh Token Grant: The flow that involves the exchange of a Refresh Token for a new Access Token.\n","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/post/oauth2.0/","section":"post","tags":["security","oidc","oauth2.0"],"title":"Oauth2.0"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/tags/oidc/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Oidc"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/tags/security/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Security"},{"body":"Introduction I will use this site to record my air plane craft life including:share teaching docs/videos,materials ,airplane models,electronic things.\n","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/post/starting_recording_my_airplanecraft_life/","section":"post","tags":["airplanecraft"],"title":"airplancraft"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/tags/airplanecraft/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Airplanecraft"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/categories/airplanecraft/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Airplanecraft"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.airplanecraft.com/en/tags/devops/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Devops"},{"body":"Devops DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.DevOps is complementary with Agile software development;\nCI/CD is a best practice for devops and agile development. CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation in building, testing and deployment of applications. CI/CD services compile the incremental code changes made by developers, then link and package them into software deliverables. Automated tests verify the software functionality, and automated deployment services deliver them to end users. The aim is to increase early defect discovery, increase productivity, and provide faster release cycles. The process contrasts with traditional methods where a collection of software updates were integrated into one large batch before deploying the newer version.\nModern-day DevOps practices involve:\ncontinuous development, continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment, continuous monitoring Tools for differrent phase\nTest Types Unit Test Function coverage Statement coverage Path coverage Function Test In functional testing, each function tested by giving the value, determining the output, and verifying the actual output with the expected value.\nPositive testing determines that your application works as expected. If an error is encountered during positive testing, the test fails.\nNegative testing ensures that your application can gracefully handle invalid input or unexpected user behavior\nRegression Test Regression Testing is defined as a type of software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features Functional testing is performed to ensure all functionalities of an application is working as expected, whereas regression testing is performed once a build is released to check the existing functionality. System Integration Test SIT with client real /client simulator environment User Acceptance Test User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a type of testing performed by the end user or the client to verify/accept the software system before moving the software application to the production environment.\nPerformance Test Performance testing is a testing measure that evaluates the speed, responsiveness and stability of a computer, network, software program or device under a workload. Organizations will run performance tests in order to identify performance-related bottlenecks. Various Devops tools Jenkins for Test Automation(Build Deploy Test) Jenkins is a popular CI orchestration tool. It provides numerous plugins for integration with multiple test automation tools and frameworks into the test pipeline.\nRuns Automated Test Suites: Jenkins provides plugins for various test frameworks like Selenium, Cucumber, Appium, Robot framework, etc. These can be integrated into CI pipelines to run automated tests for every build Summarizes the results: Most plugins also summarize the test results and display them as an HTML page. Provides Trends: Jenkins keeps track of results and displays them as a trend graph. This offers a better view of how the tests have fared in the past. Display details on Test Failures: Test results are tabulated, and failures are logged with the test results.
